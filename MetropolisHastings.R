# This script is simulating numbers for a linear regression model.
# We have three parameters, slopt, intercept, and standard deviation
# of error. 
# 
# likelihood distribution: poisson distirbution, lambda=1
# prior distributions: slope: gamma(3,7), intercept: unif, sd: exponential(5)
# proposal distributions: Normal((1,2,3), (1,4,9))
