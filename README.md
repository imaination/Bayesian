## Purpose
Exploring Simulation Method for Beyesian Study.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore sampling methods derived from algorithms in the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) family called the Metropolis sampling and Gibbs sampling methods. These MCMC algorithms are used in a bayesian setting where direct sampling from the posterior distribution is difficult. By being able to sample from complicated distributions we are able to estimate mean and other parameters to further analyze the data. In order to check for performance (speed and accuracy)of those sampling methods, we shall use a known posterior distribution so the distribution obtained from Metropolis and Gibbs sampling methods can be compared. Therefore, the setting of the sampling distribution is Multinomial - Dirichlet conjugate with K = 3 categories (three-dimensional parameters) to update.
